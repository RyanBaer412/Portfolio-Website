    <h2>Audio Narrative</h2>
    <p>For my Audio Narrative I decided to talk about the use for Offensive Linemen in football.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a podcast about football, but not just football. I am focusing on the most important aspect of the game of football, the trenches also known as the offensive line. I dive into some aspects of offensive linemen that I believe that people do not quite understand, and also that people need to learn. I focused on what it is like being an offensive linemen and the mentality you need to have to be one. 
I used many of different ways to get my point across to the people, like how I used to in game scenarios to help people fully understand what goes through a linemen head in game. I also used sound effects to help the listener feel like they were actually in the action, with the crowd noise, and the grunts and set hut. 
I used a quote from offensive linemen Will Campbell which was posted by LSU media, and I also used an example from offensive line trainer Duke Manryweather of OL Masterminds
I think my overall understanding of how to use Audacity has improved, but I wish I would have chosen a topic that I could have used more statistical facts on instead of mostly opinionated statements. 
I used the professors advice of splitting up the clips instead of doing on big talking session so that it flows together much easier</p>

    <h2>Video Essay</h2>
    <p>For my Video Essay I took on the topic of Artificial Intelligence</p>
    <p>Summary This is just a simple introduction to my essay. I introduced my thesis and who it is meant for. I used - A videoA pictureText I feel like I still can do some more research on my topic and to sample a little more effects. I am going to do more research on how to use premier pro so I can take my project to the next level. I explained how AI is effecting the way education is happening now. AI is making it harder for teachers to do their jobs because they have to do more work checking to make sure that kids are not just using AI. AI is also going to make educators have to decide whether or not AI is good for kids and if they should allow it. What the main topic I really dove into was how AI is affecting our critical thinking skills, and our ability to do stuff on our own. My main point was that AI could be a very big help to us if we let it be, it does not have to be a burden to us. If we use AI to enhance our work instead of using it as a tool to do our work for us it could be very helpful.</p>
