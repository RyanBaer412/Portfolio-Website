    <p>My first project was an audio narrative on Offensive linemen. I talked about how they operate and stuff that people might not know about OL play
    </p>
    <p>My second project was a video essay on Artificial Intelligence. I talked about how AI can either be a helpful tool, but it can also be a weapon to us.</p>

   <h3>Learning Process</h3>
   <p class="one">Throughout this class I have learned how to use a couple of applications that can help me throughout my life. We learned how to record soundtracks and make podcasts while also making and editing video essays.</p> 
   <p class="two">This final project has been one of the more enjoyable assignments in my college career. The whole process of it by advancing our knowledge of visual code each week to be able to make our projects better has been a lot of fun</p>
